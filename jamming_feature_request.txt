Feature Request: Only display songs in search results that are not already added to the playlist
April 9th 2018

## OBJECTIVE
To only display songs in the search results that are not currently present in the playlist. 

## BACKGROUND 
Users can currently search for any song, artist or album with the Jamming app. However songs already found in their playlist can appear in the search results. This creates several problems at the user experience level:

- It can be tedious for users to read through the list and skip songs that they already have in their playlist.

- Users can accidentally add songs that are already in their playlist, causing duplicates.

- Songs are not removed from the results list when added to the playlist and vice versa.
    
- Overall, these can be frustrating and time consuming, creating a poor user experience. Poor user experience can lead to raising drop-off rates.

This feature accomplishes the following:

- Displays a list of the user's search results.

- Allow user to select one of the search results and add it to her playlist. The selected song is removed from the search results list and appears in the playlist being created.

- Allow user to select a song in her playlist and remove it from her playlist. The selected song is returned to the search result list.


## TECHNICAL DESIGN

### Check that songs are not already in the playlist before adding to search results list

We will create a new method called matchTracks in the SearchResults component to check if the id of each track in the search results matches any of the track ids in the PlayList component. If there is a match of track.ids, then that track will not get added to the search results list.

### Remove track from search results when added to playlist

We will create a method in the SearchResults component to hide a track from the search results list, when added to the playlist. 

### Remove track from playlist
