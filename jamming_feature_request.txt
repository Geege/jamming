Feature Request: Remove songs from search results when added to the playlist
April 9th 2018

## OBJECTIVE
To remove tracks in the search results as they are added to the playlist, and return tracks back to the search results if they are removed from the playlist.

## BACKGROUND 
Users can currently search for any song, artist or album with the Jamming app. However songs found in their playlist remain in the search results list, once they've been added. This creates several problems at the user experience level:

- It can be tedious for users to read through the list and skip songs that they already have in their playlist.

- Users can accidentally add songs that are already in their playlist, causing duplicates.

- Songs are not removed from the results list when added to the playlist and vice versa.
    
- Overall, these can be frustrating and time consuming, creating a poor user experience. Poor user experience can lead to raising drop-off rates.

This feature accomplishes the following:

- Displays a list of the user's search results.

- Allow user to select one of the search results and add it to her playlist. The selected song is removed from the search results list and appears in the playlist being created.

- Allow user to select a song in her playlist and remove it from her playlist. The selected song is returned to the search result list.


## TECHNICAL DESIGN

### Remove track from search results list when added to playlist

First we alter the addTrack() method in App.js to add the track from the search results lists when it gets added to the user's playlist. 

To do this, we create a new variable in the method once we've added the track to the playlist. This variable (trackIdx) will take into account the track's index and set it at -1 (an arbitrary that has no value in an index).

Then we iterate over the searchResults array using forEach to find the index of the track to remove from the search results.

If we find a track to remove from the list, we remove the track and update the state for both the playlist and the search results list.  


### Add track to search results list when removing track from playlist

Here we alter the removeTrack() method in App.js to add the track being removed from the playlist to the search results list.

First, we remove the track from the playlist (as it is already done in the app). 

Then we add the track to the search results list by using the push() method.

Then we update both the playlist and the search results' states.  


## CAVEATS

### Removed playlist track gets pushed to the bottom of search results

With this implementation, removed playlist tracks find themselves at the bottom of search results list. Ideally, they would appear in the original search results order or at the top of the list so that users are aware that they've been returned to search results.
